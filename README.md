# Neural-Network
Multi-layered convolutional neural network.  Used Python 3.8, Pytorch, NumPy, and the Pycharm IDE.

Long description: built a multi-layered convolutional neural network using the Pycharm IDE, Python, NumPy, and Pytorch. The network was
trained to distinguish pictures of cats versus pictures of dogs and was trained with the Microsoft Cats vs Dogs
dataset. In some pictures the dogs or cats were the focus of the picture, while in other pictures the animals were not
the focus.
